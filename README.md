# verilog Project 

## Topic ##
This is a ECE241 project, it's a car racing game.

## Description of the project ##
Our project idea entails developing an interactive keyboard-based racing game where players control their cars and the frequency of their keyboard taps determines the car's speed. A timer tracks players' progress as they race to the finish line, and dynamic sound effects adjust to the speed of the car to create an exciting audio experience. In addition, the game provides players with a variety of options to pick from by using two dedicated keyboard keys—one for speed control and the other for path selection—which encourage players to make strategic decisions during gameplay.
